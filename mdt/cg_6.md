Researchers evaluated the effect of a traumatic brain injury on the risk of a person developing depression. The outcome measures included the incidence of depression post-traumatic brain injury per 1,000 person-years, reported below. 
During the duration of the study, incidence of depression in the post-traumatic brain injury group (mean 79.5, 95% CI = [78.5, 80.5]) was higher than for those without traumatic brain injury (mean 33.5, 95% CI = [33.1, 34.0]). The authors concluded that the risk of depression shows a statistically significant increase after traumatic brain injury events. (Based on: Journal of Neurotrauma. Jan 2019. p. 300-307)
