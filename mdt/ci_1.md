Select two music genres that you wish to compare and the audio feature that will be analyzed from the dropdown menus on the left. Draw a sample for each genre by clicking on the ‘Draw sample’ button on the left once (both samples will be drawn at the same time!). Note that each sample is composed of 100 data points, and their data distributions are shown in the two histograms that appear at the top of the page (i.e., two first graphs).
