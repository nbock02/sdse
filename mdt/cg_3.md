The "audio parameters" dropdown menu lets you compare genres using different audio features.
Look at [this site](https://www.therecordindustry.io/spotify-audio-features/) for descriptions of the 
different features that Spotify uses. **Try changing the audio feature and then press the “draw data point” button a bunch of times. 
Does changing the audio feature change your conclusions about whether these two genres are significantly different from one another?** Again, change the number of data points to draw if you want to populate the plot more quickly.
